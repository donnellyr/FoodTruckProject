# FoodTruckProject

# Description
A program that will store user input information about food trucks in an array, and will return the average rating, the highest rated truck and a complete list of inputed trucks when prompted. Intended for use in java ver 1.8
# Technology used
Scanner - Scanner was used to obtain user data to be store in an array.

array - arrays were used to store the user data and distribute the contained data when prompted.

for loops - used to iterate over our arrays so that data can be store at instances, and to access specific iterations for retrieval.

while loop -  used to have a menu that will repeatedly prompt the user with options until the quit option is selected.

switch statements - used to execute the options presented in the menu when prompted by user input and exit the loop when the exit option is selected.

if statements - used to exit the for loop iterating over our array when the user enters "Quit" or "quit" as a truck name. 

# What i Learned
I learned how to store values in an array so that they can be retrieved later. As well as discovering that a for loop can iterate over multiple arrays at once.
